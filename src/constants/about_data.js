    " I am a Software Engineer with extensive experience Frontend Developer working with React and Bootstrap for Infolytx, Inc. I have 3 years of experience working in an agile team who solves various problems based on AI and Machine Learning. There my responsibilities are to develop a responsive and user-friendly frontend application to represents the big data to users. In this role, I worked mainly with frontend technologies like ReactJS and VueJS along with reactstrap and react-bootstrap. I used jest to write unit testing and practiced TDD to make sure 80% test coverage is done. By using sonarcloud, I made sure there is no code smells and passed the sonar cloud code quality. With the help of jenkins I automated the CI and CD process. I also worked closely with AWS services. With the backend team, sometimes I help them with writing restful api with python flask. As working in a AI based company, I have some experience in AI and ML which may help. I feel that my javascript, ReactJS, unit testing, python, and other software engineering skills would be an asset in this role.",
